# Restaurant Orders Analysis


## Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant's operations by investigating the relationship between menu offerings and customer purchasing patterns. Using MySQL, I performed a deep dive into two primary datasets—menu items and order details—to uncover key performance indicators such as dish popularity, categorical revenue, and order volume. By integrating these tables through relational joins, I was able to pinpoint high-value transactions and identify specific categories, such as Italian cuisine, that drive significant customer interest. The analysis employs advanced SQL techniques, including grouping, filtering, and subqueries, to transform raw transactional logs into actionable insights for menu engineering and operational efficiency.
