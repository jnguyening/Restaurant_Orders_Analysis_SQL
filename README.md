# Restaurant Orders Analysis using SQL


## Overview

This operational study integrates transactional order data with menu metadata in MySQL to optimize restaurant profitability. The analysis utilizes Left Joins and Aggregations to identify high-margin "star" items versus low-performing "dogs," while modeling peak service hours through order density analysis. The project demonstrates the ability to convert raw point-of-sale data into actionable menu engineering strategies, supporting data-driven decisions on pricing and inventory management.
